# Runtime compilation

## Rationale
Would be nice

## Tools
- nelua: typed lua system that can compile to C
- tiny c compiler: compile c to dll
- MemoryModule: in memory loading of dll file

## Notes
- libtcc.dll should be used and libtcc lua wrappers written such that nelua can call libtcc.
- nelua should be rewritten to give back the dll in byte form.
- memory module handler should handle the byte data to load the dll in memory (to avoid writing dlls to disk).
- avoid the Anti Virus somehow
